# Kubernetes Recipes [Video]
This is the code repository for [Kubernetes Recipes [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/kubernetes-recipes-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788831901), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Kubernetes is Google's solution to manage a cluster of containers. Kubernetes provides a declarative API to manage clusters while giving us a lot of flexibility. This course will provide you with recipes to better manage containers in different scenarios in production using Kubernetes.
You will first learn and gain the concepts of containers and over the top how Kubernetes orchestrate the underlying container technology. Next, you will learn how to create highly available Kubernetes cluster and how to run programs on Kubernetes. Then you will be introduced to networking, storage, load balancer and Cluster DNS with practical hands-on. After that you will learn about Kubernetes self-healing and auto-scaling. Finally we will rap-up with monitoring your Kubernetes infrastructure and application though Prometheus and Grafana.
Upon completion of this course, you will be able to use Kubernetes in production and will have a better understanding of how to manage your containers using Kubernetes.
