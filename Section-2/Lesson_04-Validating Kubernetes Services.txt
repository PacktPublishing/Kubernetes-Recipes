Ensure that all the nodes are in ready state if not we can troubleshoot it. So the one reason would be the swap functionality enabled on the node or not.

# swapoff -a (which disable the feature on swap on the current node)

If you want it to permenantly disable the swap comment the swap line in /etc/fstab and type the below command

# mount -a

For the confirmation 

# free -h
# cat /proc/swaps

If for some reason the swap feature is disabled than we need to check the kubelet service on that node.

# kubelet logs node-01

Or if that is not working we need to ssh that node and get the logs of kubelet via journalctl command.

# journalctl -u kubelet -f

Next we need to check the services of kubelet kube-proxy process running on the master and worker node

# ps -aux | grep kube-proxy

and also for kubelet

# ps -aux | grep kubelet

and finally we can get the overall information and status of the cluster using the kubectl

# kubectl cluster-info
